- Installing packages and the requirements.txt
- The requirements.txt file is a file where you can specify all the dependencies (the installed packages that your project depends on) and their versions.
- This means that you can share your project without all the installed packages, making it a lot more lightweight.
- When someone downloads your project (like you have done here), the requirements.txt file tells their code editor which packages need to be installed.

- 🎗️ To install Flask-WTF you would use the pip install command.
- 🎗️ You can install all the required packages listed in the requirements.txt file for the project at the same time: 

- On Windows type:
