|**PROJECT**|

- This is a basic HTML and URL parsing with ***Flask***.
- The program will start on the home page, with a welcome and a picture. 
- A random will have been created and the user will try to guess it. 
- Users need to put a number at the end of the URL. E.g. http://127.0.0.1:5000/1
- Depending on the user's guess, the screen will show low, high, or found replies with related images.
