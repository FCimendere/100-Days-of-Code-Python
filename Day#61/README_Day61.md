|**REQUIREMENTS**|
|---|
- Installing packages and the requirements.txt
- The requirements.txt file is a file where you can specify all the dependencies (the installed packages that your project depends on) and their versions.
- This means that you can share your project without all the installed packages, making it a lot more lightweight.
- When someone downloads your project (like you have done here), the requirements.txt file tells their code editor which packages need to be installed.

- 🎗️ To install Flask-WTF you would use the pip install command.
- 🎗️ You can install all the required packages listed in the requirements.txt file for the project at the same time: 

- On Windows type:
* 		python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
- On MacOS type:
* 		pip3 install -r requirements.txt


|**PROJECT**|

- This is **WTForms, Validation, Flask, Bootstrap** Practise. 
- Forms are created by **Flask-WTForms** and **CSRF** protection was added.
- Some form areas are created using libraries of WTForms, e.g. StringField, and PasswordField.
- Forms objects are passed over dynamically via label property.
- **Validators** are used to control whether the email address is correct, the same, has enough characters in it, etc.
- **Jinja2** uses inherited templates.
- Design is improved via Bootstrap Frameworks.
